# CSC322 Group Project: Business Transaction System
# Carlos Rodriguez, Misael Perez, Md Omit

## System Overview
This system allows users to conduct secure business transactions. There are three types of users: Visitors (V), Users (U), and Super-users (S).

## User Roles & Permissions

### Visitor (V)
- Can browse item listings and provide comments.
- Can apply to become a User (U), subject to approval by a Super-user (S).
- To prevent automated applications, applicants must answer a random arithmetic question to verify they are human.

### User (U)
- **Account Management**: Can deposit and withdraw funds from their account.
- **Item/Service Listings**: 
  - Can list items or services they own with a specified price for sale or rent.
  - Can list items or services they need with an acceptable price range.
- **Bidding**: 
  - Can bid on listed items/services, provided they have adequate funds. Bids include a deadline.
  - The item owner decides which Userâ€™s offer to accept for a sale or rental.
- **Transaction Completion**:
  - Once an agreement is reached, the item is removed from the listing, and funds are transferred from the buyer/renter to the owner.
  - After the transaction:
    - The buyer/renter can rate the owner on a scale of 1 (worst) to 5 (best).
    - The owner can rate the renter.
  - Ratings are anonymous to avoid retaliation or biased feedback.
- **Complaints**: Users may file a direct complaint to a Super-user about other Users they have transacted with.

### Super-user (S)
- Approves Visitor applications to become Users.
- Handles complaints and has authority over suspensions and reactivations.

## User Ratings & Suspensions
1. **Low Ratings**:
   - Users with an average rating below 2 from at least three ratings are suspended.
   - Reinstatement requires either a $50 fine or Super-user approval.
2. **Rating Behavior**:
   - A User with an average rating (from 3 or more reviews) below 2 (considered overly harsh) or above 4 (considered overly generous) will also be suspended.
3. **Repeated Suspensions**:
   - A User suspended three times will be permanently removed from the system.
4. **User Quit Option**:
   - Users can choose to quit the system by applying to a Super-user.

## VIP User Status
1. A User becomes a VIP if they meet all of the following criteria:
   - Have over $5,000 in their account.
   - Have completed more than five transactions.
   - Have no complaints against them.
2. **VIP Benefits**:
   - VIPs receive a 10% discount on all transactions.
   - VIPs retain all regular User privileges.
3. **Loss of VIP Status**:
   - If they no longer meet the criteria, VIPs revert to regular User status.
   - A VIP who qualifies for suspension will be downgraded to a regular User instead of being suspended.

## Personalized Interface
- A User-specific GUI should display information tailored to each User based on their previous transactions and records.

## Creative Feature (10% Bonus)
- Implement one unique feature that adds creativity to the system, worth up to 10% of the total project points. Examples include:
  - A live bidding session, with a game-like, time-sensitive feature, organized and exclusively accessible by VIPs for VIP-owned items.
  - Any other special, creative feature will be eligible for a bonus (up to 10%).
